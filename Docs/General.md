# General notes

## True-colour displays
- From: http://cd.textfiles.com/ataricompendium/BOOK/HTML/CHAP7.HTM
- True-color devices allow each pixel to have a unique color value. Rather than palette entries, colors (work_out[13]) corresponds to the number of available virtual pens. Drawing is accomplished by using these pens, however, unlike using a palette, changing the color of a pen does not change any pixel's color drawn with that pen on the screen.
